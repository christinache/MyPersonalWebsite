        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Christina and I am an energetic, empathetic, and eager first-generation student who is passionate about education, women empowerment and sustainability</p>
        <p>As an aspiring product manager, I am curiosity-driven in everything that I take on and enjoy learning and working in fast-paced environments. Additionally, I value opportunities that have inspiring visions and opportunities for growth.</p>
        <p>I have both product and entrepreneurial experience in various industries and am passionate about improving user experience through design, especially in tech! I love building communities at Babson through problem-solving, program management, and execution. I have started new initiatives, shifted perspectives, and seen growth in Alpha Kappa Psi (co-ed business fraternity), Reynolds Campus Center, TEDxBabson College, and more. If you need someone who gets things done, letâ€™s work together :)</p>
