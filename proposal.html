    <section>
        I plan on creating a website featuring me, similar to a personal website featuring my professional portfolio. 
        The objective of my website is for recruiters to get a deeper insight to my story:
        <ul>
            <li>About Me</li>
            <li>Work Experience</li>
            <li>Leadership Experience</li>
            <li>Passion Projects</li>
            <li>Skills</li>
            <li>Interests</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        My target audience are recruiters from the tech industry who want a deeper look beyond my resume.
        I hope that my personal website will give a more well-rounded, unique perspective to me. 
        My sitemap will include:
        <ol>
            <li class="bigger"><b>Home</b></li>
                <ul>This section will be the welcome page with my name and my career interest: Product Management and Program Management.</ul>
            <li class="bigger"><b>About Me</b></li>
                <ul>This section will have a quick introduction of me, from where I go to school and my overall passions and interests. It will follow the format of an interview "tell me about yourself," where I will also go into detail how I suit my intended career paths.</ul>
            <li class="bigger"><b>Work Experience</b></li>
                <ul>This section will be similar to a resume; however, it will combine my work experience and leadership experience. I may separate work experience from leadership experience. I haven't exactly decided yet.</ul>
            <li class="bigger"><b>Personal Projects</b></li>
                <ul>This section will include my self-started projects from this website, to other programming projects or personal programs, outside of work and Babson affiliation.</ul>
            <li class="bigger"><b>Skills</b></li>
                <ul>This section will include both my hard and soft skills. It can be separated into programming skills, technical skills, product management skills, project management skills, soft skills...etc.</ul>
            <li class="bigger"><b>Contact Info</b></li>
                <ul>This section will have my address, email, phone number, and social contacts. My social will have my LinkedIn, and possibly Github.</ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        It will follow a full-scroll down site structure compared to completely separate pages.
